# **Project 1: E-commerce Database Analysis (SQL + Tableau)**

## **Project Description**
This project aims to explore an e-commerce database to gain strategic insights into customer behaviors, sales, and product performance. I will use SQL and Python for data analysis and Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that will present the results clearly and accessibly.

## **Main Objectives**
1. **Understand Sales Trends:**
   - Analyze seasonal revenue.
   - Identify the presence of seasonality (e.g., spikes during sales or holidays).

2. **Evaluate Product Performance:**
   - Discover the most sold product categories and those with the highest revenue.

3. **Analyze Geographic Behavior:**
   - Identify the most profitable regions/cities.

## **Visualizations in Tableau**
### **Main Dashboards**
1. **General Overview:**
   - KPIs: Total revenue, number of customers.

2. **Customers and Behaviors:**
   - Visualization of customer segments.

3. **Geographic Analysis:**
   - Interactive map with revenue by region/city.

4. **Product Performance:**
   - Best-selling products and most profitable categories.

## **Possible Project Extensions**
- Integrate a sentiment analysis of reviews to evaluate customer perception of products.
- Implement a model to suggest optimal pricing strategies.
- Link the data to marketing platforms to suggest targeted campaigns.

## **Tools Used**
- **SQL**: For extracting and analyzing the data.
- **Python**:
  - Statistical analysis (pandas, numpy).
  - Forecasting and clustering.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards.
